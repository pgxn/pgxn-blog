                                    <h1>About the Logo</h1>
                    <p>I decided to get on creating the PGXN logo sooner rather that later, both to create a stronger identity for the project and to have a uniform look across the various services (the <a href="http://pgxn.org/">site</a>, <a href="http://blog.pgxn.org/">blog</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/pgxn/">twitter stream</a>, <a href="http://ident.ca/pgxn/">identi.ca</a>, etc.). So I began hunting around for useful iconography to inspire a design direction.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.iconfinder.com/icondetails/40094/128/data_database_seta_icon"><img src="http://cdn.iconfinder.net/data/icons/database/PNG/128/Database_1.png" alt="Database Icon" style="float:right"/></a></p>

<p>Let me tell, you, that&rsquo;s a lot easier than it sounds. After browsing through images returned for queries such as &ldquo;pixin,&rdquo; &ldquo;pig skin,&rdquo; &ldquo;zen,&rdquo; &ldquo;zen stones,&rdquo; &ldquo;pixies,&rdquo; and god knows what else, I finally focused on &ldquo;database icon.&rdquo; This was much more useful, as I hit on images such as the one to the right. Pretty standard database icon, right? Three disks stacked up. I&rsquo;m not sure why this is the classic graphical abstraction for a database, but I&rsquo;ve seen it a zillion times. So often that it&rsquo;s a cliché.</p>

<p><a href="http://dryicons.com/free-icons/icons-list/grace-icons-set/"><img src="http://dryicons.com/images/icon_sets/grace_icons_set/png/128x128/database.png" alt="Abstract Database Icon" style="float:left"/></a></p>

<p>Much more interesting was stumbling onto the icon to the left. I love how three disks have been broken down to their simplest possible representation. Because I&rsquo;m familiar with the cliché, I can see at a glance exactly what this icon is supposed to be. So I thought that might be useful to use.</p>

<p><a href="http://findicons.com/icon/920/extension_manager_cs3"><img src="http://png-2.findicons.com/files/icons/33/adobe_family/128/extension_manager_cs3.png" style="float:right"/></a></p>

<p>Searching for &ldquo;extension icon&rdquo; was a bust. Most of the relevant images, like the one to the right, seemed to be related to Adobe Extension Manager (try to find a link for that!). I didn&rsquo;t want to go near that, of course. But, inspired by the <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> logo, I searched for &ldquo;library icon.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cpan.org"><img src="http://www.cpan.org/misc/jpg/cpan.jpg" alt="CPAN Logo"/></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.iconarchive.com/show/icons-10-bundle-icons-by-icontoaster/library-icon.html"><img src="http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/icontoaster/icons-10-bundle/128/library-icon.png" style="float:right"/></a></p>

<p>Bingo! I hit on the amazing icon at right. <em>Of course!</em> Gears make a great icon for extensions, don&rsquo;t you think? This folder is like an extension library folder. So then I thought, how can I combine these two icons, the abstract database and the gear?</p>

<p>Well it&rsquo;s simple, isn&rsquo;t it? The database icon can be the holes in the extension gear. It&rsquo;s punched out, right? PGXN will offer loads of database extensions to download (we hope), and when you use one in your database, PostgreSQL will, you know: <em>turn the gear.</em> It just fits.</p>

<p><a href="http://pgxn.org/"><img src="http://pgxn.org/images/icon.png" height="128" style="float:left; height:128px; padding-right: 15px;"/></a></p>

<p><a href="http://strongrrl.com/">Strongrrl</a> created the logo and type treatment based on these ideas, adding the tilt and the figure/ground reversal, and I really love it. It&rsquo;s a really great logo for a database extension site. I imagine I can use variants of this throughout the final design.</p>
