                                    <h1>Quick Status Update</h1>
                    <p>Sometimes I wish I weren&rsquo;t such a perfectionist.</p>

<p>But not often.</p>

<p>A quick update:</p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;ve spent 43 hours on the <a href="http://github.com/theory/pgxn-manager" title="PGXN Manager repository on GitHub">PGXN Manager</a> database. I had estimated 24 hours. Ha ha ha ha ha!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent 45 hours on the implementation of the app itself. I had estimated 40 hours.</p>

<p>How will I make up the difference? I&rsquo;m not sure, really. I&rsquo;ve already under-recorded my hours quite a lot, basically donating my time to create <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?SemVer">SemVer</a> and to create the basic HTML layout for the site (I suck at design, but found <a href="http://andreasviklund.com/templates/andreas07/">a good template</a> to base it on). That will likely continue. This is an OSS project, and while I&rsquo;m getting paid to work on it thanks to our <a href="http://pgxn.org/contributors.html">generous contributors</a>, I&rsquo;m also contributing quite a lot of time to it.</p>

<p>Speaking of contributors, we&rsquo;ve still not quite met our fundraising goals. There&rsquo;s enough there for me to finish PGXN Manager so that you can start releasing your extensions on PGXN, and for me to start on the search and documentation site, but not finish it. If you know any organizations that would like to sponsor this work and get their name and link on the PGXN site in perpetuity, please <a href="http://pgxn.org/">send them over!</a>.</p>

<p><em>Ahem.</em></p>

<p>So what have I been doing? I&rsquo;ll write up some notes in a few other blog posts, including how I&rsquo;m generating JSON in the database, using <a href="http://plackperl.org/">Plack</a> for the app, and nicely-degrading Ajaxification with <a href="http://jquery.org/">jQuery</a> and RESTful URLs (I hope!). The main page of the app works, as does authentication via basic auth. There&rsquo;s a screen to request a user account, and a UI for PGXN admins to accept or reject such requests. To make it actually usable, I just need to add the upload feature for users, and then I can do a first release. That will allow people to sign up, get approved, and start uploading extensions for distribution on PGXN.</p>

<p>I <em>will</em> get that that done this week.</p>

<p>After that, I&rsquo;ll add screens for users to edit their account information, change passwords, reset passwords, and edit permissions. I expect each of those to take less time, as they&rsquo;ll use a lot of the infrastructure I&rsquo;ve already built.</p>

<p>Watch this space, and thanks for your patience!</p>

<p>Oh, and if you want to help out, please do fork <a href="http://github.com/theory/pgxn-manager" title="PGXN Manager repository on GitHub">PGXN::Manager</a> and ping me in #pgxn on Freenode for the deets on getting it built.</p>
