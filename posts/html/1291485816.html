                                    <h1>How Can I Detect a Proxied SSL Request?</h1>
                    <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how best to create two sections of the PGXN Manager site, one that requires authentication and is on SSL and one that&rsquo;s public. So far, I&rsquo;ve just had all the authenticated stuff go to /auth (because I&rsquo;m using basic auth), but what I want to do now is require authentication if the connection is via SSL. However, using a reverse proxy with mod_proxy to map to the PGXN Manger Plack app running on an internal port, I&rsquo;ve found no environment variables passed through that would allow me, in code, to determine whether a request is via a proxied SSL or non-SSL connection. Most irritating.</p>

<p>So tell me what you think about the alternative plan I&rsquo;ve come up with.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll have two plack apps, one mapped to /auth and one mapped to /no-auth. The former will require authentication and the latter will not. They&rsquo;ll have separate dispatch tables, of course. Then I&rsquo;ll have the SSL site proxied to /auth and the non-SSL site proxied to /no-auth. Makes sense, right?</p>

<p>The only hangup I can see (though maybe you can see others?) is that my current method of generating URIs knows nothing about proxies. So If I link to /auth/account, when requests come through the proxy, it should actually create a link to /account. Does it make sense to use relative links instead of absolute links for all links to avoid this issue? I think it might be kind of annoying, because not all the code is aware of the current URI, though there are ways to deal with that.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>I guess I could stick with absolute URLs, and then have the <a href="http://github.com/theory/pgxn-manager/blob/master/lib/PGXN/Manager/Request.pm#L14"><code>uri_for</code></a> use <code>$req−&gt;uri−&gt;path</code> for a proxied request and <code>$req−&gt;path_info</code> for a non-proxied request.</p>

<p>Sure would be nice if there was some way to tell from the environment that a request was forwarded from an SSL connection, though. Alas, there are only three extra environment variable set by the proxy server:</p>

<ul>
<li>HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR</li>
<li>HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST</li>
<li>HTTP_X_FORWARDED_SERVER</li>
</ul>

<p>No HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PORT or HTTP_X_FORWARDED_SSL or SSL_ENABLED or anything like that. Maybe I&rsquo;m missing something in my reading of the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html">mod_proxy documentation</a>?</p>
