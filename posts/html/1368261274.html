                                    <h1>Reserved Extensions</h1>
                    <p>I&rsquo;m thinking about how to add support for reserved extensions. These are extensions that one needs to depend on, but aren&rsquo;t distributed via PGXN. Primarily, this means stuff distributed with the PostgreSQL core, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>PostgreSQL itself</li>
<li>Bundled procedural languages (plpgsql, plperl, etc.)</li>
<li>All <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/contrib.html">contributed modules</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Basically, anything that an extension might want to declare as a dependency, but that isn&rsquo;t on PGXN itself.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways to do this. Which do you think would be the best approach?</p>

<ol>
<li>Hard-code a list into the source code</li>
<li>Include an editable list in the runtime configuration file</li>
<li>Add a database table reserved for them and an API to edit it</li>
<li>Create a &ldquo;pgdev&rdquo; user and upload a distribution declaring all those extensions in a <code>META.json</code> file</li>
<li>Same as 4, but actually upload the PostgreSQL source</li>
</ol>

<p>I&rsquo;m leaning towards #2, perhaps having it automatically maintain a list in the database and a metdata file on the mirrors.</p>

<p>But what do you think? Opinions wanted!</p>
