                                    <h1>Fundraising and Development Update</h1>
                    <p>Yesterday was a busy day. In addition to making the <a href="http://blog.pgxn.org/post/1352326020/first-upload">first PGXN release</a>, I updated the fundraising spreadsheet and then the thermometer displayed on the <a href="http://pgxn.org/contributors.html">main site</a>. The good news is that things are coming along nicely. Thanks to recent contributions from <a href="http://www.commandprompt.com/">Command Prompt</a>, <a href="http://www.marchex.com/">Marchex</a>, Hitoshi Harada, and <a href="http://www.25th-floor.com/">25th-floor</a>, we are now just $2500 short of our goal of $25,000. Thank you all!</p>

<p>Can you help us get to our goal in time for <a href="https://www.postgresqlconference.org/2010/west/">PgWest 2010</a>, which is November 2-4 in San Francisco? I&rsquo;ll be giving a talk there, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.postgresqlconference.org/content/building-and-distributing-postgresql-extensions-without-learning-c">Building and Distributing PostgreSQL Extensions Without Learning C</a>&rdquo;, in which PGXN will of course be featured. Would be great to announce that the fundraising was successful.</p>

<p>As for the time I&rsquo;ve put in so far, I&rsquo;m happy to have PGXN Manager up and working, but of course it has taken more hours than I expected. 76.5 so far. I&rsquo;d estimated 40. Meanwhile, the database design is up to 43 hours from the estimated 24. And that doesn&rsquo;t count the hours I spent chasing shiny yaks and shaving them, like <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?SemVer">SemVer</a> and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Router::Resource">Router::Resource</a>. Those of you who estimate development projects, take heed! I clearly need to double all my estimates before I submit them.</p>

<p>Still, with the fundraising nearly done, I&rsquo;m committed to finishing this project. I view it as a project budget, and so that&rsquo;s what it will be, whether or not it takes me twice or four times as many hours as I&rsquo;d estimated.</p>

<p>That said, you could help. Right? PGXN Manager is in good shape, but it&rsquo;s not done. If you&rsquo;d like to roll up your sleeves and contribute some code, please <a href="http://github.com/theory/pgxn-manager/">fork it</a>, build it, and hack what you can. A few things on the to-do list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add user admin interface. Should include checkbox to make and remove administrative permission</li>
<li>Add mirror admin interface</li>
<li>Add extension ownership permissions interface</li>
</ul>

<p>The database API is there for these bits already; the code would mainly be in Perl. Hit me on #pgxn on <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">Freenode</a> if you want to help.</p>

<p>If documentation is your thing, contributions there would be appreciated, as well. In particular, the <a href="http://manager.pgxn.org/about">About PGXN</a> page is a bit thin. Other interfaces will need help, too. More on that as we add users.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone for your support!</p>
