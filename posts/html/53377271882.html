                                    <h1>PGXN Distribution Prerelease Versions Fixed</h1>
                    <p>A couple years ago, the <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Version</a> specification was <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/semver/commit/05a00df02db3d4ba83e0caaff6b31c10c77f7d3d">updated</a> to require a hyphen between the &ldquo;patch version&rdquo; and the &ldquo;prerelease version.&rdquo; This despite the fact that v1.0.0 of the spec had been published on the site for a while (see all the gory issues <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/semver/issues/49#issuecomment-19705479">here</a>). Naturally, I had already implemented that format for PGXN in a <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/SemVer">Perl module</a> and <a href="http://pgxn.org/extension/semver/">Postgres data type</a>. Since we already had some PGXN extensions with the non-hyphenated format, and I knew supporting the hyphen would break them, I held off updating those implementations for a year or so.</p>

<p>I finally broke down and updated them, though, to be fully compliant with the official v1.0.0 spec, and pushed the changes to the PGXN server a few months ago. And I was right: it <em>did</em> break things. Links broke, downloads failed, and my mailbox filled up with error messages. I triaged the worst of the issues, but since then, accessing PGXN distributions with prerelease versions has not worked so well.</p>

<p>Until last night. I finally got some tuits in the last month to dig into this issue and figure out how to fix it. As a result, there are new releases of <a href="http://manager.pgxn.org/">PGXN Manager</a>, <a href="http://api.pgxn.org/">the API</a>, and <a href="http://pgxn.org/">the site</a>, as well as <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/PGXN::Meta::Validator">the <code>META.json</code> validator</a> that should keep things consistent and working well going forward. Assuming there are no more backwards-incompatible changes to semantic versions, of course.</p>

<p>But that still didn&rsquo;t solve the problem of existing distributions with the old format of semantic version. Alas, I had to download them all, modify them, and re-index them. This means that, if you had URLs to prerelease versions laying around, they won&rsquo;t work anymore. Fortunately, they&rsquo;re prerelease versions, so I wouldn&rsquo;t expect many to have them lying around anyway.</p>

<p>Still in the interest of disclosure (and because their SHA1s have changed), here&rsquo;s a list of the changed distributions:</p>

<p>Apologies for the dead links, and for taking so long to get this stuff cleaned up.</p>
