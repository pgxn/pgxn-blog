                    <p>I&rsquo;m off to Chicago today for <a href="http://www.postgresopen.org/">Postgres Open</a>, a new PostgreSQL conference. I&rsquo;m pleased that I&rsquo;ll be presenting &ldquo;<a href="http://postgresopen.org/2011/schedule/presentations/83/">Get Your Preferred Feature Developed!</a>&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are lots of developers out there who, like me, have ideas for projects they want to work on for PostgreSQL, but don&rsquo;t have the free time to make it happen. The idea for this talk is to pitch this fact to an audience of organizations with a major investment in PostgreSQL and an interest in seeing it improve. Perhaps one or more of them will look into sponsoring development of something that interests them, or that they need. This way, interested developers might get <em>paid</em> to work on projects that interest them, to the benefit of the project, the community, and of course their sponsors. Naturally, I&rsquo;ll be drawing on PGXN as an example of how this sort of thing can work.</p>

<p>If you'e like to learn more, tune in! The whole conference will be live-streamed. Check <a href="http://www.postgresopen.org/" title="Postgres Open">the site</a> on Wednesday to get hooked up.</p>
