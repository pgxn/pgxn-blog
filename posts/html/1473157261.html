                                    <h1>PGWest, Search Site Sneak Peak</h1>
                    <p>I&rsquo;ve been working on my <a href="https://www.postgresqlconference.org/content/building-and-distributing-postgresql-extensions-without-learning-c">PostgreSQL Conference West presentation</a>, which heavily features PGXN, of course. I think it&rsquo;s looking good. If you&rsquo;re at <a href="https://www.postgresqlconference.org/2010/west/">PGWest</a> or are in the San Francisco area and free, come see the talk! Should be a good introduction to creating PostgreSQL extensions and distributing them on PGXN. The latest bit I added is a section on the modifications needed to support the forthcoming <a href="http://s.coop/pgext"><code>CREATE EXTENSION</code></a> support slated for 9.1. Fortunately it&rsquo;s dead simple, and will make dealing with extensions in the database a lot simpler, administratively. Really looking forward to that. Of course I&rsquo;ll post slides once the talk is over.</p>

<p>As part of preparing for the talk, and because there isn&rsquo;t currently much to actually <em>see</em> of PGXN, I&rsquo;ve been mocking up the layout for the new search site, which as you know from the <a href="http://pgxn.org/status.html">status page</a> is the next part of the project I&rsquo;m slated to work on. I&rsquo;ve been committing the mockps to the gh-pages branch of the repository, which means you can see what it looks like live on the net <a href="http://theory.github.com/pgxn/">right here</a>. That&rsquo;s the home page, including our sponsor links and tag cloud. Click the &ldquo;PGXN Search&rdquo; button to see a mockup of search results (or get them <a href="http://theory.github.com/pgxn/results.html">here</a>). Click on any search result to see the mockup of a documentation page (or link it <a href="http://theory.github.com/pgxn/pgtap.html">here</a>). The design is based on the <a href="http://www.oswd.org/design/preview/id/2839">lazydays</a> open-source Web design, and I&rsquo;m quite happy with it. Your thoughts?</p>

<p>As this comes together, I&rsquo;m gearing up to start hacking on the app to produce the search site. At this point, I&rsquo;m thinking that it would become the new home page for <a href="http://pgxn.org/">PGXN</a>, rather than a separate search.pgxn.org site. Thoughts?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll post the slides tomorrow.</p>
