                    <p>Just a quick note to say that <a href="https://manager.pgxn.org/">PGXN Manager</a> has been updated with more secure password storage. Existing passwords are unmodified, but the next time you change your password, it will be upgraded to a more robust password hashing algorithm that&rsquo;s more resistant to attacks. I recommend everyone update their passwords. If you have a PGXN Manager account, just hit <a href="https://manager.pgxn.org/account/forgotten">password reset</a>, enter your username or email address, and check your mail for a reset link. Once you update your password, it will be stored in the new, more secure format.</p>
