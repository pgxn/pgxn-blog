                                    <h1>Case Insensitivity</h1>
                    <p>I pushed out new versions of PGXN::Manager, PGXN::API, and PGXN::Site today, all with the aim of resolving some issues with case-sensitivity. I was alerted to this when Daniele Varrzzo released <a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/italian_fts/">italian_fts</a> with the <a href="http://pgxn.org/tag/italian/">Italian tag</a> and the API sync blew up. Oops.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s the deal. The following objects have case-insensitive names on PGXN:</p>

<ul>
<li>Distributions</li>
<li>Extensions</li>
<li>Versions</li>
<li>Users (nickname)</li>
<li>Tags</li>
</ul>

<p>These names are case-preserving, so they should show up with the proper capitalization in JSON files and whatnot. But to avoid issues with URLs, I decided that all file names should be lowercase only. Fortunately, nearly everything was lowercase already: only a few nickname JSON files were not lowercased, plus the files for <a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/pgtap/">pgTAP</a>. So once I got the code updated, I renamed those files appropriately. In the case of the pgTAP download, I actually re-indexed it, so that the prefix in the zip file would properly be &ldquo;pgtap-0.25.0&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;pgTAP-0.25.0&rdquo;, since the file name is now <code>pgtap-0.25.0.pgz</code>.</p>

<p>So why make these objects case-insensitive? Well, because I tend to think of the names of things as having <em>meaning</em>, and really, there is no difference in meaning between &ldquo;pgtap,&rdquo; &ldquo;pgTAP,&rdquo; or &ldquo;PGTap.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve relased pgTAP; I think it would be as confusing as hell if someone else released a completely different distribution named &ldquo;PGTap.&rdquo; (And I went through a bit of hell when the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Apache::test">Apache::test</a> CPAN module was replaced with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Apache::Test">Apache::Test</a>, a completely new module. It really messed things up on the case-insensitive file system I use).</p>

<p>But as I said, the case is preserved in the name I use, just not in the names of files. So if you look at the <a href="http://pgxn.org/dist/pgtap/">pgTAP distribution page</a>, you&rsquo;ll see that &ldquo;This Release&rdquo; is labeled &ldquo;pgTAP 0.25.0&rdquo; (I need to fix the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element still).</p>
