                                    <h1>Question: Ajax and Search Engine Indexing</h1>
                    <p>I&rsquo;ve started working on the main (search) site in earnest now. The basic layout is done, and I&rsquo;m working on the distribution view (<a href="http://theory.github.com/pgxn/pgtapdist.html">mockup</a>). My thinking so far has been that I would simply serve a page that requested, say, <code>/dist/pgTAP/</code>, and that page would use Ajax requests to fetch the data from the <a href="http://api.pgxn.org/">API server</a> and display stuff. I think this will work pretty well except for one thing: 404s.</p>

<p>That is, if you request <code>/dist/nonexistent/</code>, then it will load a page with the HTTP status code <code>200 OK</code>, but then, when the Ajax request 404s, it will show a &ldquo;Not found&rdquo; error message. That&rsquo;s all well and good, but I&rsquo;m wondering about the impact of two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Since the page itself won&rsquo;t 404, search engines might index links to nonexistent extensions. Of course, bad links won&rsquo;t be <em>that</em> common, but of course they do happen and then tend to live forever.</p></li>
<li><p>If the search site uses Ajax to fetch the contents of a page via JSON (or, for documentation, as an HTML document it will put into a div), will the full content be properly indexed by search engines?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So these are serious questions, in my mind. Do we loose good search engine indelibility when we load content dynamically?</p>

<p>Of course, I can instead write it so that the back end fetches stuff from the API server (and perhaps directly from the file system) and get &lsquo;round these issues, but then it&rsquo;s less of a cool example of the use of the API server.</p>

<p>What do you think? Good advice much appreciated!</p>
