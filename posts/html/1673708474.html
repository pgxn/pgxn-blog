                    <p>PGWest Slides, Back to Work</p>

<p>Well, back to work a bit, anyway. Tomorrow is Thanksgiving in the U.S., so I&rsquo;m not likely to do much more until next week. But I&rsquo;ll be heads down on it, then, working to get the search site done.</p>

<p>Before I talk about that, though, I realize that I forgot to post the link to my slides from <a href="https://www.postgresqlconference.org/2010/west/">PGWest</a>. I actually posted them <em>before</em> the talk, I just never got round to mentioning it here. So, here it is:</p>

<div style="width:425px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-bottom:20px;" id="__ss_5670848"><strong style="display:block;margin:12px 0 4px"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/justatheory/building-and-distributing-postgresql-extensions-without-learning-c" title="Building and Distributing PostgreSQL Extensions Without Learning C">Building and Distributing PostgreSQL Extensions Without Learning C</a></strong><object id="__sse5670848" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=extendingpostgresql-101104153959-phpapp01&amp;stripped_title=building-and-distributing-postgresql-extensions-without-learning-c&amp;userName=justatheory"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"><embed name="__sse5670848" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=extendingpostgresql-101104153959-phpapp01&amp;stripped_title=building-and-distributing-postgresql-extensions-without-learning-c&amp;userName=justatheory" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></div>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty happy with how it came out. The organizers shot video of it, too; I&rsquo;ll post a link or embed when it drops.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I <em>have</em> returned to work on the <a href="http://theory.github.com/pgxn/">search site design</a>. How do you like it? The pages I&rsquo;ve completed the design for are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://theory.github.com/pgxn/">Search/Home Page</a></li>
<li><a href="http://theory.github.com/pgxn/results.html">Search Results</a></li>
<li><a href="http://theory.github.com/pgxn/pgtap.html">Extension documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://theory.github.com/pgxn/pgtapdist.html">Distribution information</a></li>
<li><a href="http://theory.github.com/pgxn/theory.html">Owner information</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Imagine if all open-source PostgreSQL extensions were posted on this site. You could search through them all, including their documentation, browse their docs, find related extensions, and see what else the extension owner has worked on. All in one place, without downloading anything. That&rsquo;s the plan for this site. Notice anything missing you think should be there? Let me know.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m going to start work on the app to create this now, but before I do, I wanted to point out the PGXN project <a href="https://github.com/theory/pgxn/wiki/PGXN-Wish-List">wish list wiki</a>. Folks have been having all sorts of ideas for features that would be great for PGXN, and I don&rsquo;t want to lose track of them. So if you&rsquo;ve had any ideas at all, no matter how big or small, <em>please</em> feel free to add them to the wiki. As the project progresses, some I might be able to just build in, but others I might want to see go onto a project road map. What do you want to see on the road map?</p>

<p>Oh, and if you want to see <em>your</em> extensions on this site, please do <a href="http://manager.pgxn.org/account/register">register a PGXN Manager account</a>. Once your account is approved (and we&rsquo;re pretty quick to do so), have a look at the <a href="http://manager.pgxn.org/howto">how to</a> and release your extensions on PGXN today!</p>
